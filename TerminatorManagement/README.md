# Terminator Storage Management in a Hangar 

## Context 
You are managing a hangar that stores "Terminators" (robots). Each Terminator has a unique ID and a priority level. The hangar operates as a queue to allow robots to be deployed in the order they arrived. However, higher-priority Terminators can skip the line and be placed at the front.
## MPV
- Data Structure: Use a LinkedList to represent the queue.

### Terminator Class: Create a Terminator class with:
- Int id (unique ID of the Terminator)
- Int priority (priority level, default is 0)

### Features:
- Add Terminators to the queue.
- Add a high-priority Terminator to the front of the queue.
- Deploy the first Terminator in the queue (remove it).
